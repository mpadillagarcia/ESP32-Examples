# ESP32-Examples
This repository provides a collection of examples and projects for the ESP32, a high-performance, low-power microcontroller. The examples focus on using the ADXL343 accelerometer via the I2C interface, enabling developers to efficiently capture and process acceleration data.

The repository also includes examples of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication to transfer acceleration data to mobile and other BLE-compatible devices. Additionally, it showcases integration examples with the IoT platform Thingsboard, allowing real-time visualization of acceleration data in a user-friendly interface.

Another feature included in this repository is communication via the MQTT protocol, enabling bidirectional communication between the ESP32 and other MQTT-enabled devices or services, facilitating integration with broader IoT systems.

Lastly, the repository provides examples of communication using the NFC interface and SPI protocol. This feature allows wireless interaction with NFC-compatible devices, making setup and data exchange fast and secure.

With this repository, developers can access a variety of examples that leverage multiple features of the ESP32 and ADXL343 accelerometer to build customized IoT solutions, monitoring and motion detection systems, portable applications, and more.
